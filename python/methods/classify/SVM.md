# Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines (SVM) seek to find the hyperplane (plane in the 3D case, line in the 2D case) which best separates the data into their respective classes. If the data cannot be separated in the original space, the data is 'lifted' into higher dimensional space such that the data is separable by a hyperplane.

SVM therefore can work well on many distributions of data. Support vector machines tend under-perform when given categorical data, as this requires the input data to be manipulated in a way that points can be represented in space. Further, SVM tends to take very long to work with complex kernels and in high dimensional space, making it infeasible for complex machine learning tasks on lesser hardware.
