# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes (NB) is an algorithm that uses [Bayes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) of conditional probability to determine classification. The 'naive' assumption of NB is that all features are [conditionally independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence) from eachother. This means that NB cannot handle non-linearlly separable data, nor does it perform well when the assumption of conditional probability does not hold.
